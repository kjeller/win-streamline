# What is this?

This is a collection of batch (bat?) scripts that makes my life easier when re-installing Windows.

| Script       | Description    |
|--------------|----------------|
| [winget](winget/README.md)    | Downloads a collection of applications that I find useful. |
| [winset](winset/README.md)    | Sets regedit values that I find useful (dark mode, hide activation watermark, etc) |
